CONSIDER:
after finishing with octree implementation, consider a stack of quadtrees implementation:
-the y(or any other) dimension of the cube is divided into a consant amount by being an array of quadtree slices
-the array only needs the head as the rest is pointers
-advantages being a potential speed boost by knowing which y slice(s) the vector from the camera intersects
--though one has to consider: what if the vector intersects a slice on the bounding box, but goes through it and intersects the model at a different one
